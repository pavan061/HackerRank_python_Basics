#Task
#Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

#If n is odd, print Weird
#If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print Not Weird
#If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
#If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

#sample input=3
#sample output=Weird

#sample input=24
#sample output=Not Weird


# Program:
# --------


import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
if n%2==1: #To check if n is odd since mod operator(%) gives the remainder
    print('Weird')
elif n in range(2,6) and n%2==0: #here range gives us the numbers from 2 to 5 but not 6
    print("Not Weird")
elif n%2==0 and n in range(6,21):
    print("Weird")
elif n>20 and n%2==0:
    print("Not Weird")
